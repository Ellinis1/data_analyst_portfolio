This is my portfolio, showcasing my projects as a Data Analyst

Hi, I'm Anna! I come from a background in Finance and Accounting, having worked in AdTech at Criteo for 8 years. In that time I led a team of process experts in Finance, analyzed monthly publisher spend, implemented KPI and dashboards for stakeholders, implemented automation strategies to optimize closing process, reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy. I am excited to bring my experience in the field of data analytics
